# CookJoy Recipe Page: Best Chocolate Cake

This project showcases a simple recipe page for a fictional recipe-sharing website, "CookJoy." The page focuses on a single recipe, the "Best Chocolate Cake," and is designed with a warm and inviting aesthetic.

## Design Specifications

The page adheres to the following design specifications:

-   **Recipe Title:** "Best Chocolate Cake"
-   **Background Color:** Warm cream (#FFF5E1)
-   **Accent Color:** Rich chocolate brown (#6B4226)
-   **Ingredients:** A bulleted list of ingredients.
-   **Instructions:** A numbered list of step-by-step instructions.
-   **Typography:**
    -   Headings: Georgia Bold, 22px
    -   Body Text: Arial, 16px
-   **Images:** Includes a placeholder image for the final dish (currently a static image).
-   **Responsive Layout:** The layout is designed to be clearly organized on both desktop and mobile devices.

## File Structure

This repository contains the following file:

-   `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure and styling of the recipe page.
-   `README.md`: This file, providing information about the project.
-   *(Potentially)* `images/`: A directory that might contain the cake image (though currently linked directly).

## How to Use

You can view this recipe page by simply opening the `index.html` file in any web browser.

## Technologies Used

-   HTML5: For the structural markup of the page.
-   CSS3: For styling the page according to the design specifications, including colors, typography, and basic responsiveness using media queries.

## Image Source

The cake image displayed is sourced directly within the HTML. In a real-world scenario, this would likely be an asset within the project's `images/` directory or fetched from a content delivery network (CDN).

## Responsive Design

The CSS includes a media query to adjust the layout for smaller screens (up to 768px width), ensuring that the ingredients and instructions remain readable and well-organized on mobile devices.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for this recipe page could include:

-   Adding more details about the recipe (e.g., preparation time, cook time, servings).
-   Implementing user ratings and comments.
-   Including nutritional information.
-   Making the image dynamically loadable.
-   Improving the overall visual design and user experience.

## CookJoy

"CookJoy" is a fictional recipe-sharing website created for this design task.
